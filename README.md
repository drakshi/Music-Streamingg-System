# Music-Streaming-System
 Fully functional, but feature-limited, version of an online music player.This is a clone web application using the create-react-app. The app consumes data from the Spotify API and tries to mimic the UI and front-end behaviors of the official Spotify web player as much as possible.
If a user login to a premium account (due to the limitation of the available API, free accounts cannot do much), user can access certain routes to their own playlists, saved items, etc. and use the app as a remote control play.
